# E-commerce Platform With Real Time Inventory Management

### Project Overview

Develop a comprehensive e-commerce platform built as a single, modular Spring Boot application. The application will support functionalities such as user management, product catalog, order processing, and real-time inventory tracking. Spring Security ensures robust JWT-based authentication and role-based access control. PostgreSQL is used for data persistence, and Docker Compose helps set up and run the application and database consistently on any machine.

### Core Features

- **User Management & Authentication**
    - **Registration & Login:** Secure user registration and login endpoints.
    - **JWT Authentication:** Implement JWT tokens for stateless session management.
    - **Role-Based Access:** Differentiate between roles (e.g., ADMIN and USER) to control access to specific functionalities.

- **Product Catalog**
    - **Product CRUD Operations:** Manage products with details like name, description, price, and category.
    - **Search & Filtering:** Implement basic search and filter capabilities for products.

- **Order Processing**
    - **Order Creation & Management:** Allow users to place orders, view order history, and manage order statuses.
    - **Transactional Integrity:** Ensure orders are processed with proper transaction management.

- **Real-Time Inventory Management**
    - **Stock Updates:** Automatically update inventory levels as orders are placed or canceled.
    - **Real-Time Notifications:** Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push live inventory updates to the frontend.
    - **Low-Stock Alerts:** Trigger alerts when stock levels drop below a certain threshold.

- **Testing & Quality Assurance**
    - **JUnit Tests:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability.
    - **Mocking:** Utilize Mockito for effective unit testing of service layers.

### Technical Stack

- **Java 21:** Leverage the latest Java features for clean and efficient coding.
- **Spring Boot:** Build and configure the monolithic application with ease.
- **Spring Security:** Secure endpoints using JWT tokens and implement role-based access control.
- **Lombok:** Reduce boilerplate code in entities, DTOs, and other classes.
- **JUnit & Mockito:** Ensure robust testing of application components.
- **PostgreSQL:** Reliable relational database for persisting data.
- **Docker Compose:** Simplify deployment and environment setup by containerizing both the application and the PostgreSQL database.

### Implementation Roadmap

1. **Project Setup**
    - Initialize a new Spring Boot project using Maven or Gradle.
    - Add necessary dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Lombok, PostgreSQL Driver, and Spring Boot Starter Test.

2. **Module Organization**
    - **User Module:** Develop entities and controllers for user registration, authentication, and role management.
    - **Product Module:** Create entities and services to handle product data and operations.
    - **Order Module:** Implement order processing logic, ensuring that orders are tied to user accounts and update inventory accordingly.
    - **Inventory Module:** Build real-time inventory tracking with WebSocket or SSE support for live updates.

3. **Security Configuration**
    - Configure Spring Security to protect endpoints and validate JWT tokens.
    - Set up role-based access rules ensuring admins and users have appropriate permissions.

4. **Database Configuration & Migrations**
    - Configure PostgreSQL connection settings in your Spring Boot application.
    - Use Flyway or Liquibase for managing database schema migrations.
    - Develop entity relationships (e.g., User, Order, Product, Inventory) using Spring Data JPA.

5. **Real-Time Functionality**
    - Integrate WebSockets or SSE in Spring Boot to send real-time updates for inventory changes.
    - Implement a frontend component (if needed) to subscribe to these real-time notifications.

6. **Testing**
    - Write unit tests for controllers, services, and repositories using JUnit.
    - Use Mockito to mock dependencies and isolate test cases.
    - Optionally, include integration tests with an embedded PostgreSQL instance or Testcontainers.

7. **Containerization with Docker Compose**
    - Create a `Dockerfile` for building the Spring Boot application container.
    - Set up a `docker-compose.yml` file to run:
        - The Spring Boot application container.
        - A PostgreSQL container with environment variables for user, password, and database configuration.
    - Test local deployment to ensure seamless communication between the application and database.

8. **Enhancements & Documentation**
    - **API Documentation:** Integrate Swagger/OpenAPI for clear API documentation.
    - **Monitoring & Logging:** Use Spring Actuator for health checks and implement centralized logging.
    - **Performance & Scalability:** Consider caching strategies (like Redis) if needed, and design the application for potential horizontal scaling.
